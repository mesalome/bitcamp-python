# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS


## Beginning 
I'm creating a software which will play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with a user. 
To do this I need:
1. user to be able to input their choice
2. computer generating random choice
3. outputting both choice 
4. outputting winner

    ### rock, paper, scissors Rules

        * Rock beats Scissors
        * Paper beats Rock
        * Scissors beats Paper

## Advancements
to advance software I can add additional functions:
1. ask user after first game if they want to keep playing
2. quit game if they press anything other than Y
3. make game much more COMPLICATED by adding additional actions: Lizard and Spock

    ### rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock Rules

        * Rock beats Scissors
        * Rock beats Lizard
        * Paper beats Rock
        * Paper beats Spock
        * Scissors beats Paper
        * Scissors beats Lizard
        * Lizard beats Paper
        * Lizard beats Spock
        * Spock beats Rock
        * Spock beats Scissors
