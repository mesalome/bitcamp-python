“All vanity plates must start with at least two letters.”
"vanity plates may contain a maximum of 6 characters (letters or numbers) and a minimum of 2 characters.” / 2 <= length <= 6
 Numbers cannot be used in the middle of a plate; they must come at the end. For example, AAA222 would be an acceptable … vanity plate; AAA22A would not be acceptable. The first number used cannot be a ‘0’.” 
 No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.”
